          About This Page
        </Title>
        <Text mt="md">
          Hello and welcome to the KB Component Library documentation site! This is your go-to resource for exploring and configuring a variety of reusable UI components built with Lit. Our library offers a collection of components such as alerts, badges, action avatars, and timelines, designed to enhance your web applications with rich, interactive elements.
        </Text>
        <Text mt="md">
          What makes this library particularly valuable is its ability to bring dynamic and customizable components to Knowledge Base (KB) pages, which often lack such a variety of UI elements. Whether youâ€™re building a KB page, a blog, or a full web application, you can use this site to configure components to your liking and then seamlessly integrate them into your projects.

          Guide: How to Use This Site
        </Title>
        <Text mt="md">
          This documentation site is designed to be interactive, allowing you to configure and preview components before using them in your own pages. Hereâ€™s how you can get started:
        </Text>
        <List mt="md" spacing="sm">
          <List.Item>
            <Text>
              <strong>Explore the Components</strong>: Use the navigation menu on the left to browse the available components, such as Alert, Badge, Action Avatar, and Timeline.
            </Text>
          </List.Item>
          <List.Item>
            <Text>
              <strong>Configure the Component</strong>: Each component page has a "Styles" section where you can adjust properties like color, size, and variant. Modify these controls to see the component update in real-time.
            </Text>
          </List.Item>
          <List.Item>
            <Text>
              <strong>Add Content (if applicable)</strong>: For components that support custom content (e.g., Timeline items, Alert messages), use the "Content" section to add or edit content such as titles, descriptions, or dates.
            </Text>
          </List.Item>
          <List.Item>
            <Text>
              <strong>Preview Your Changes</strong>: The component will be displayed in the preview area, showing how it looks with your customizations. This allows you to experiment until you find the perfect configuration.
            </Text>
          </List.Item>
          <List.Item>
            <Text>
              <strong>Copy the HTML</strong>: Once youâ€™re happy with the componentâ€™s appearance, go to the "Generated HTML" section at the bottom of the page. Copy the HTML code to use in your own project.
            </Text>
            <Code block mt="xs">
              {`<ak-badge variant="filled" color="#228be6" radius="12px" size="md">BADGE</ak-badge>`}
            </Code>
          </List.Item>
          <List.Item>
            <Text>
              <strong>Integrate into Your Page</strong>: To use the component on your page, include the KB Component Library bundle via a script tag, then add the copied HTML to your project:
              <Code block mt="xs">
                {`<script src="https://akharytonchyk.github.io/kb-component-lib/assets/lit-bundle.js"></script>`}
              </Code>
              Then paste the component HTML into your page, such as a Knowledge Base page, to add rich UI elements where theyâ€™re typically not supported.
            </Text>
          </List.Item>
        </List>
        <Text mt="md">
          By following these steps, you can easily configure and use our components to enhance your web pages, especially for KB pages that often lack such a variety of interactive elements.
